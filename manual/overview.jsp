<p>Welcome to the Freeciv-web Game Manual! This document explains the
standard rules under which Freeciv-web is played. If you need other
information, like how to run the game on your machine, or what windows
and menus it will present on your screen, you may want to browse the
other manuals and tutorials that are available. <br>
</p>
<p>The various topics on this game manual are divided into many
sections, which you can choose between in the tab menu on top of this
page.<br>
</p>
<p>This manual covers the latest stable version of Freeciv-web, which
is mostly compatible with Freeciv 2.5.&nbsp;
</p>

<p>In Freeciv-web you compete against several opponents to found
cities, use them to support a military and economy, and finally to
complete an empire that survives all encounters with its neighbors to
emerge victorious. Each opponent may be either another human or be
controlled by the computer. All players begin at the dawn of history
with a handful of units - typically with an explorer and a couple of
settlers in 4000 BC and race to expand outward from those
humble beginnings.
</p>
<p>Most of your map will be blank when the game begins, save for the
terrain adjacent to your first settlers; only as your units travel and
discover the oceans and continents of the world will the rest of the
map be revealed (though players may share their maps by arranging a
pact). Note that your map is only the record of the terrain and cities
your units last encountered in an area you will not learn
about changes in an area until your units visit again, nor can you
observe the movement of enemy units that are out of sight of your units
and cities.
</p>
<p>Though the game is played in turns, the players themselves do not
take turns but are all allowed to move at once. At the beginning of
each turn all units are assigned movement points, which are spent as
they move and act. Using up movement points early in the turn may leave
a unit without the ability to respond if an opponent approaches later
in the turn. Units cannot carry extra movement points into the next
turn; any movement points left when the turn ends are lost (unless the
unit has been given an order like fortify that only takes effect at the
end of the turn). Turns can either be of unlimited length, ending only
when all players have pushed their turn done button, or can have a time
limit when the turn ends regardless.

<p>Achieving success requires a balance between economic expansion,
military strength, and technological development. Not only must you
develop all three in concert to both expand and successfully defend
your empire, but any of the three may provide victory over your
opponents:
</p>
<ul>
  <li> As in other games of conquest and expansion, you are declared
the winner by default once the last city and unit of every other
civilization is destroyed. </li>
  <li> Once technological progress has brought you into the space age,
you may launch a spacecraft destined for Alpha Centauri; the first
civilization whose craft reaches the system wins. </li>
  <li> In the absence of other means to determine victory, the game
will end in the year 2000 AD if no spacecraft have yet been launched.
The surviving civilizations are then rated, and the one with the
highest score is the winner. </li>
</ul>

<p>In Freeciv-web there are three rules levels:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>hardcoded rules </li>
  <li>rules from the ruleset </li>
  <li>rules from server options. </li>
</ul>
<p>This manual describes the basic rules which Freeciv-web supports out
of the box. After learning this version of the rules you will be able
to play in other situations by learning the ways in which those
configurations differ from the vanilla rules described here.&nbsp;
